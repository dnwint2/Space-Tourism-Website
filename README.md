# Space-Tourism-Website
Practice Website for a fictional space tourism company - designed to facilitate HTML and CSS practice!
This website is designed to be viewed full screen, and is not currently adaptive. It uses only non-grid, non-flex CSS with almost entirely pixel unit attributes,
so it works well on a 1440px x 900px and nowhere else. It's quite brittle.

I created this website after finishing the advanced css section of Dr. Angela Wu's Web Development course. The HTML/CSS is currently messy, with redundancies, etc.
I'd like to revisit this in a short time, Lord willing, and rewrite it using an industry standard scheme, say, BEM, and perhaps CSS flex or grid.
